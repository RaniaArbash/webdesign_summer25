    <p>Spring in Canada is a time of renewal and transformation. As the snow melts, landscapes come alive with blooming
    flowers, budding trees, and the return of birds from their winter migrations. Temperatures gradually warm up, and
    Canadians begin to enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and gardening. 
    <br>Though spring arrives earlier in
    southern regions and later in the north, it brings a shared sense of freshness and hope across the country.
